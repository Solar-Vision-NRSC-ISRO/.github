# Solar Vision - NRSC ISRO

Welcome to the **Solar Vision** project developed under the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of ISRO. This repository hosts the code and resources for a deep learning-based solution to detect solar panels from spatial images. The project aims to enhance the efficiency of solar energy monitoring and analysis using advanced computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

The Solar Vision project utilizes state-of-the-art object detection models to identify and analyze solar panels in high-resolution satellite images. This technology can significantly aid in solar energy assessment and planning, providing valuable insights into solar infrastructure across various regions.

### Inference Websites

The project offers two inference platforms where users can upload images to analyze solar panel coverage:

- **High-Resolution Inference Site**: This site processes high-resolution images to detect solar panels. Access it here: [High-Res Inference](https://solar-vision-inference-high-res.streamlit.app/)

- **Low-Resolution Inference Site**: This site is optimized for low-resolution images, providing quick results with acceptable accuracy. Access it here: [Low-Res Inference](https://solar-vision-inference-low-res.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- **Real-time Solar Panel Detection**: Users can upload images, and the model will identify solar panels in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The inference sites are designed with a simple and intuitive interface to facilitate easy interaction.
- **Multiple Resolution Support**: Choose between high-resolution and low-resolution image processing based on your needs.
